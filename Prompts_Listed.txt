1. Kickoff & Format
2. How to start solving this project.
3.Create the full project in specified JSON format.
4. Story & Character Setup
5.Paraphrase Rohan Patel’s story from the provided document.
6. Develop date-wise structure of conversations.
7. Define Elyx team members’ roles, personalities, and voices (Ruby, Dr. Warren, Advik, Carla, Rachel, Neel).
8. Incorporate Sarah (personal assistant) in scheduling but not as focal point.
9. Real-Life Context & Behavior
10. Show Rohan as a family man (wife, 2 kids).
11. Include disruptions from kids’ school, wife’s commitments, family obligations.
12. Business meetings, frequent travel (UK, US, Korea, Jakarta).
13. Time-zone impacts on messaging.
14. Adherence ~50%, occasional stalling/lying.
15. Doctors gently reprimand at times.
16. Health Program Design
17. Test panel listing (blood tests, imaging, genetics, cardio, brain, nutrition).
18. Explain “intervention loop” (Week 1 onboarding → Week 20 review).
19. Rohan’s goals (reduce heart risk, improve cognition, annual screening).
20. Conversation Simulation (Month by Month)
21. Month 1–2: Onboarding, wearables, scheduling, biological samples, early test reports.
22. Month 3–4: Results discussion, first dips, 3-month exam.
23. Month 5–6: Performance dip, deadlines, pessimism, doctors step in for second test.
24. Month 7–8: Encouragement, stabilisation, clinical closure (progress made, gaps remain).
25. Data Handling & Refinement
26. Create ~600 messages (later reduced to ~500, varied lengths).
27. Ensure organic, single-person conversations (not random jumps).
28. Merge month-wise files into one chronological JSON (Feb 3 – Oct 5, 2025).
29. Assign consistent IDs, realistic timestamps across time zones.
30. Competition Preparation
31. Compile all prompts cleanly for report submission.
32. Summarise methodology: storyline design, organic conversations, integration of life context, structured clinical closure.
33. Read the following patient chat log and extract key medical events (symptoms, vitals, medications, lifestyle habits, concerns). Structure the data in JSON with fields: date, event, category (symptom, lab, lifestyle, medication, follow-up), and notes.
34. From this chat log, extract any numerical health metrics (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, hours of sleep) occurring between Feb 2 and Oct 5. Normalize them to standard units. Output a structured timeline in JSON.
35. Identify lifestyle habits (exercise, sleep quality, stress levels, diet) mentioned in this chat log. Summarize them weekly for the period Feb 2 – Oct 5.
36. From the conversation, extract medications, dosage, frequency, and whether the patient reports adherence or not for the period Feb 2 – Oct 5.
37. Using the structured patient data (metrics + lifestyle notes from Feb 2 – Oct 5), generate a dashboard summary with 3 key highlights: (1) Overall health trend, (2) Critical alerts, (3) Improvements, (4) messages from the doctors
38. Create a line chart timeline of Blood Pressure, Sleep Hours, and Cholesterol from Feb 2 – Oct 5 based on the extracted patient data. Emphasize fluctuations in April–June and improvements toward October 5.
39. Make an analytic counting the metric of how each message can be classified and who wrote what messages.
